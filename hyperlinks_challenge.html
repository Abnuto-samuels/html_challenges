      <h1>What i have learned</h1>
      <p>I am currently studying coding at LifeChoices. I learned that i can make use of Atom to design my web page because it helps you with the codes and its better than notepad. The first thing they have learned us is how to design a web-page. I got the opportunity to play around with some codes to see what will actually happen if I had to insert a code.</p><p> I also learned how to insert an image on the web-page. We did some paragraphys,heading and table for us to get use to the code we will be using most of the time. From tables we moved on to forms and hyperlinks.</p><p> In the form i was introduce to creating my own online form and a lot of different things we can do in a form such as adding checkboxes,comment boxes,submit buttons and a lot of other rules.</p><p> This week we start with some CSS which i was waiting for. With the help of css i learned how to make my page colourful and to make it look more better and not plan. hopefully soon we will be doing java and i know that it is not going to be easy.
